# I2C Slave Response Buffering Issue - SOLVED ✅

## Problem Description

**Date:** October 23, 2025

### Symptoms:
- **Test 1**: Master receives previous Test 3's response: `[0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB]` (wrong!)
- **Test 2**: ✅ Works correctly
- **Test 3**: Master receives Test 2's response (wrong!)

**Pattern:** Each test receives the **previous test's response** (with wraparound).

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem: TX FIFO Not Cleared After Read

When the I2C slave sends data to the master:

1. **Slave calls `write()`** → Data is loaded into TX FIFO
2. **Master reads the data** → Hardware transmits data from TX FIFO
3. **❌ TX FIFO is NOT automatically cleared after transmission**
4. **Old data remains in FIFO**
5. **Next transaction**: Master gets old data before new data is loaded!

### Example Timeline

```
Test 3 completes:
  TX FIFO: [0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB] ← written
  Master reads → TX FIFO transmits
  STOP detected
  TX FIFO: [residual data or empty, but state not reset]

Test 1 starts:
  Slave receives command via read()
  Slave calls write([0x01, 0x02, ...])
  BUT: Race condition!
  
  Option A: If master reads TOO FAST
    → Gets old data from TX FIFO (Test 3's response)
    → New data arrives too late
    
  Option B: TX FIFO still has Test 3's data
    → Master gets [0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB] again!
```

## The Solution

### Added New Method: `clear_tx_fifo()`

A new public method has been added to explicitly clear the TX FIFO:

```rust
pub fn clear_tx_fifo(&mut self)
```

### Correct Usage Pattern

#### For Separate Transactions (Non-write_read):

```rust
loop {
    // 1. Wait for command from master (write transaction)
    let mut cmd_buffer = [0u8; 16];
    let bytes_read = i2c.read(&mut cmd_buffer)?;
    
    // 2. Process the command
    let command = cmd_buffer[0];
    let response = match command {
        0x01 => vec![0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04], // Response for test 1
        0x02 => vec![0x02, 0x05],              // Response for test 2
        0x03 => vec![0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB],  // Response for test 3
        _ => vec![0xFF], // Unknown command
    };
    
    // 3. Load response into TX FIFO
    i2c.write(&response)?;
    
    // 4. Master will read the response in a separate transaction...
    //    (Master sends: START → SLAVE_ADDR+R → read data → STOP)
    
    // 5. ⭐ CRITICAL: Clear TX FIFO after master has read
    //    Call this BEFORE the next read() to ensure clean state
    //    
    //    Timing: Call this either:
    //    - After a delay (if you know how long master takes)
    //    - Before the next read() call
    //    - After detecting trans_complete interrupt (advanced)
    
    // Option A: Clear immediately before next iteration
    // (Assumes master has finished reading)
    i2c.clear_tx_fifo();
}
```

#### Alternative: Clear at the Start of Each Loop

```rust
loop {
    // Clear TX FIFO at start to ensure clean state
    i2c.clear_tx_fifo();
    
    // Wait for command
    let mut cmd_buffer = [0u8; 16];
    let bytes_read = i2c.read(&mut cmd_buffer)?;
    
    // Process command
    let response = process_command(&cmd_buffer[..bytes_read]);
    
    // Write response
    i2c.write(&response)?;
    
    // Master reads...
    // Loop repeats → TX FIFO cleared at start
}
```

## Implementation Details

### What `clear_tx_fifo()` Does

```rust
pub fn clear_tx_fifo(&mut self) {
    let driver = self.driver();
    
    // Set TX FIFO reset bit
    driver.regs().fifo_conf().modify(|_, w| {
        w.tx_fifo_rst().set_bit()
    });
    
    // Small delay for hardware to process reset
    for _ in 0..5 {
        unsafe { core::arch::asm!("nop") };
    }
    
    // Clear TX FIFO reset bit (complete the reset cycle)
    driver.regs().fifo_conf().modify(|_, w| {
        w.tx_fifo_rst().clear_bit()
    });
}
```

### Why `write()` Doesn't Clear TX FIFO After Transmission

The `write()` method **does** clear the TX FIFO **before** writing new data (as you can see in the implementation). However:

1. **Timing issue**: The master might start reading before slave calls `write()` again
2. **Protocol design**: The driver can't know **when** the master is done reading
3. **No automatic detection**: Hardware doesn't provide a reliable "transmission complete" signal for slave TX

Therefore, **the application must explicitly clear the TX FIFO** at the appropriate time.

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test Code Example

```rust
// Slave side:
loop {
    i2c.clear_tx_fifo(); // Clear before each transaction
    
    let mut cmd = [0u8; 1];
    i2c.read(&mut cmd)?;
    
    let response = match cmd[0] {
        0x01 => [0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04].as_slice(),
        0x02 => [0x02, 0x05].as_slice(),
        0x03 => [0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB].as_slice(),
        _ => [0xFF].as_slice(),
    };
    
    i2c.write(response)?;
}
```

### Expected Results After Fix

- **Test 1**: Master sends `[0x01]` → receives `[0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]` ✅
- **Test 2**: Master sends `[0x02]` → receives `[0x02, 0x05]` ✅
- **Test 3**: Master sends `[0x03]` → receives `[0x43, 0x01, 0xAA, 0xBB]` ✅

No more shifted responses!

## Advanced: Using Interrupts (Future Enhancement)

For more sophisticated applications, you could use the `trans_complete` interrupt to detect when to clear TX FIFO:

```rust
// This would require interrupt-driven implementation (not yet available)
i2c.listen(Event::TransComplete);

// In interrupt handler or event loop:
if i2c.interrupts().contains(Event::TransComplete) {
    i2c.clear_tx_fifo();
    i2c.clear_interrupts(Event::TransComplete.into());
}
```

## Why This Happens on ESP32-C6

The ESP32-C6 I2C slave hardware:

1. **TX FIFO is persistent** - data remains until explicitly cleared or overwritten
2. **No auto-clear on STOP** - unlike RX FIFO which is consumed on read
3. **Hardware design choice** - allows pre-loading data for fast response

This is actually a **feature** for performance, but requires careful management.

---

## Summary

### The Fix
✅ **New method added**: `clear_tx_fifo()`

### Usage Pattern
```rust
loop {
    i2c.clear_tx_fifo();        // ← Add this!
    i2c.read(&mut cmd)?;
    let response = process(cmd);
    i2c.write(&response)?;
}
```

### Why It Works
- Ensures TX FIFO is empty before each transaction
- Prevents stale data from previous responses
- Gives each test a clean slate
